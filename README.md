#Synopsis & Motivation

I wanted an easier and more organized way to save extensive webpages and download data files.  
This file contains scripts to automate tasks in my online life, mainly the downloads of files or data.  

#Code

Utilizes: shell scripting URL requests (wget, curl), Selenium WebDriver, and Python. (for now)
